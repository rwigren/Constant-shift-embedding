# Constant-shift-embedding
Implementation of the constant shift embedding (CSE) method using similarity or dissimilarity matrices. 

The implementation is done in a manner inspired by the SciKit-Learn package. A simple example of how it can be used is shown in `CSE_example.ipynb`


The constant shift embedding method is developed for clustering and converts a problem of similarity-clustering into a K-means problem. While the theory is based on clustering, it can also be used in other related settings (such as classification). 



The code of the CSE implementation is based on:
